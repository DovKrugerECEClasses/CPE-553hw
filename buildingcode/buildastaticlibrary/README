In this directory, your job is to build a static library libmymath.a
which contains all the routines in these files.  You must also
complete the function stats.  Because C++ is not a
standardized calling sequence, you cannot call C++ functions, so
notice that the entry points are all defined in C.

This is done using the construct:

extern "C" {

}

within the brackets all definitions are C, not C++ and therefore
portable.  This also means that there is no overloading, in other words there
cannot be two functions with the same name.

C functions start with an underscore, so the name of the function f
internally is: _f

The function stats is written in Statistics.cc
You must make it compute the max and min values of the list, and compute the
mean (sum the elements and divide by the number of elements).
Then to calculate variance, for each element of the list compute
   x[i] - mean
sum the squares of this value, and divide the final sum by n

Store the four numbers min, max, mean, variance in the Statistics object.

You are not building a program, so there is no main.
In order to build a library, use the unix archive utility:

g++ -c Statistics.cc
ar rvs libstats.a Statistics.o

You should, of course, do this in a Makefile
